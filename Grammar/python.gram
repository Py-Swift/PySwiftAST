# This is Python 3.13's official PEG grammar
# We'll parse this to generate our Swift parser

# Note: This file is quite large (~2000+ lines)
# For the initial implementation, we'll focus on a subset of the grammar
# and expand coverage iteratively.

# The full grammar can be accessed from the CPython repository
